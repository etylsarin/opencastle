# Documentation Structure

<!-- Populated by the `bootstrap-customizations` prompt based on project structure. -->

Project-specific documentation layout referenced by the `documentation-standards` skill.

## Directory Tree

<!-- Map your project's docs/ directory here -->

```
docs/
├── README.md               — Documentation index
└── ...                     — Add entries as docs are created
```

## Practices

- **Check Known Issues** before starting any task
- **Review Architecture** docs for context
- **Update roadmap** after completing features
- **Add new issues** with: Issue ID, Status, Severity, Evidence, Root Cause, Solution Options
- **Archive** outdated docs rather than deleting
