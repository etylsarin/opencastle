# Workflow Templates

Declarative workflow templates for common orchestration patterns. Inspired by Sandcastle's YAML workflow engine, these templates provide reproducible execution plans that the Team Lead and prompts can reference.

## How to Use

1. **Reference in prompts** — When delegating, cite the relevant template and phase
2. **Customize per task** — Templates define the structure; fill in specific files, agents, and criteria
3. **Track progress** — Use the phase structure to update session checkpoints
